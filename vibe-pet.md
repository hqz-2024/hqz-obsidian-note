Vibe Pet is a hardware desktop pet project for AI coding agents. It watches live activity from Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and other AI coding agents in CLIs and IDEs, turns states such as thinking, tool use, waiting for approval, completed, and error into animated pets, then syncs the same state to Wio Terminal or ESP32-S3 hardware over BLE.

### Highlights

- Multi-agent pet view: every active editor or AI coding agent gets its own pet card instead of sharing one combined state.
- Real desktop pets: pets from the main window are also spawned onto the desktop, and each one can be dragged independently.
- Hardware sync: send state over Bluetooth to devices such as Wio Terminal or ESP-AI Mini Ext.
- Character switching: choose a character from [Petdex](https://github.com/crafter-station/petdex) by default or use a custom character you made.

Want to bring Vibe Pet to your own device? The BLE and Wi-Fi hardware payloads are intentionally small, so new screens, status lights, badges, and custom boards can be added without changing the desktop app.

### Download and Install

Download the installer for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/wangzongming/vibe-pet/releases).

- macOS: download the `.dmg` or `.zip` build.
- Windows: download the `.exe` installer.
- Linux: download the `.AppImage` or `.deb` package.

After installation, launch Vibe Pet and use the desktop app to connect your device. You can also use Vibe Pet without hardware if you only want the desktop pets.
